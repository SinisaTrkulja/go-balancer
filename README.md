# GO Balancer - The loadbalancer that goes #
## Work still in progress ##
### Lightweight and highly configurable (that's the goal at least) ### 


Notes to self for improvement:

- investigate healthcheck mechanism
- improve error handling
- add tls options
- ipv4 & ipv6 parsing
- long lived connections
- flags and config file
- retry mechanism
- add benchmarking
